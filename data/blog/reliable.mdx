## Autonomous Hold Trajectory Generation

### The Challenge

Flight hold patterns are safety-critical maneuvers used for traffic management. The system required a robust, automated way to generate these trajectories that adhered strictly to FAA geometric standards while handling dynamic entry conditions.

### My Contribution

I architected the end-to-end trajectory generation logic within the guidance stack. **By leveraging existing geometric primitives and data structures, I ensured the new feature was modular, consistent with the legacy codebase, and minimized code duplication.**

- **Geometric Algorithm Design:** Translated complex FAA operational constraints into computational geometry algorithms to dynamically calculate hold entry vectors and racetrack paths.
- **Safety-Critical Logic:** Implemented a **finite state machine (FSM)** to govern the hold lifecycle (Entry, Orbit, Exit). This ensured deterministic transitions and safely handled edge cases—such as altitude constraints and speed envelopes—preventing undefined behavior.
- **Verification & Reliability:** Delivered the feature with a comprehensive suite of **C++ unit and integration tests**. I integrated these into the nightly regression pipeline to guarantee trajectory continuity and stability.

## High-Fidelity Peripheral Systems Modeling

### The Challenge

To validate complex control laws in simulation, we needed higher-fidelity models of the aircraft's electromechanical actuators. Simplified linear models were insufficient for capturing real-world hardware behaviors like friction and compliance.

### My Contribution

I developed high-fidelity **physics models in C++** for the braking and control surface actuation systems.

- **First-Principles Modeling:** Derived equations of motion for the electromechanical systems, explicitly modeling **motor inertia, viscous friction, and back-EMF**.
- **Complex Dynamics:** Modeled **gear compliance** as a mechanical damping and stiffness term, enabling the simulation to capture realistic lag and resonance effects in the geartrain.
- **Coupled System Architecture:** Designed the model to couple mechanically with the aircraft's control surfaces, calculating the torque required to reject external aerodynamic loads.
- **Control Validation:** Implemented **PID controllers** to close the loop on the actuator models. I validated the system dynamics using step-input response analysis, tuning parameters to match the rise time, overshoot, and settling time of the physical hardware.
