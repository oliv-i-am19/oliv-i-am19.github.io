## Hands-On Engineering

While my professional and academic focus is primarily on control theory and software, my journey into robotics began with a genuine love for building things. My favorite part of controls remains tracing the flow of states through complex physical systems using elegant models. I strongly believe that writing good software for physical systems requires a deep, intuitive understanding of the hardware underneath.

This page is a showcase of some of my favorite hardware builds, mechanical designs, and personal fabrication projects.

### MAAV Structures Lead

I was a member of Michigan Autonomous Aerial Vehicles for 4 years, and served as Structures lead for 3. During my tenure, we designed various UAV for IARC Mission 9 and SUAS 2025. Helping take the team to its first competition in 5 years was one of my proudest accomplishments in undergrad.

### PCB Design & Motor Controller Assembly

To get a better grasp on low-level electronics, I designed a custom breakout board for a BLDC motor driver. This project involved schematic capture, PCB layout, and hand-soldering surface-mount (SMD) components.
