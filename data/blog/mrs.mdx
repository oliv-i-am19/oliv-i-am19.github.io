## Project Overview

### The Challenge

Most multi-agent systems rely on homogeneous teams (identical robots). Real-world disaster response, however, requires **heterogeneous teams**—specialized agents working in concert. I sought to explore the complex coordination problem of deploying distinct robot classes to a dynamic, expanding hazard without a central controller.

### The Solution

I developed a decentralized simulation engine in **Python** modeling a forest fire response scenario. The system coordinates two distinct agent classes:

1.  **Surveyors (Fixed-Wing):** High-speed, high-endurance scouts using information-gain algorithms to map the environment as fires develop.
2.  **Firefighters (Quadrotors):** Agile, hovering agents that perform the physical extinguishing tasks based on Surveyor data.

## Technical Contributions

### 1. Dynamic Environment Simulation

I engineered a grid-based probabilistic cellular automata simulation to model wildfire spread.

- **Stochastic Dynamics:** The environment is dynamic and non-deterministic; fire propagation probabilities increase based on adjacency to burning cells and simulated wind vectors.
- **Partial Observability:** Agents do not possess a global map. They must build a local world model through sensor readings and share updates via local communication links.

### 2. Information-Theoretic Exploration (Surveyors)

The Surveyor agents utilize an **entropy-reduction strategy** to maximize map coverage efficiency.

- **A\* Path Planning:** Implemented A\* search to navigate the grid while avoiding mapped hazards.
- **Next-Best-View (NBV):** The agents calculate a utility function based on "information gain" (unvisited cells vs. visited cells) to determine optimal flight paths, prioritizing unknown regions of the map.

### 3. Distributed Task Allocation (Firefighters)

The core innovation is the **decentralized command structure**. There is no central server; decision-making is distributed across the swarm.

- **Local Consensus:** Agents exchange map data and task states only with neighbors within a limited communication radius, simulating real-world RF constraints.
- **Distributed mTSP:** I modeled the fire assignment as a dynamic **Multiple Traveling Salesperson Problem (mTSP)**. Firefighters execute a distributed auction-based protocol to assign themselves to the nearest high-priority fires, ensuring optimal coverage without redundant assignments.
